# Discord Bot

Use this as a starting point for your python discord bot!

## Setup

#### Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/alexcamerondev/discordpy-bot.git
```

#### Install dependencies

```
pip install
```


## Start
pipenv run python3 server.py


## Service on linux
I would suggest to create a custom service that auto restarts on linux. I accomplished this with systemd.
